# Nature-View

With this two-page site, I started my self-training as a front-end developer. The site contains thumbnails of nature images with buttons that allow you to open full-size images and go to third-party sites. Both native styles and Bootstrap styles were used. A custom favicon was developed and the site is optimized for viewing on various devices.
